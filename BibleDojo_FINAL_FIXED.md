## Overview

### Background

[Basil Tech](https://basiltech.org/) is a non-profit specializing in product development for faith-based organizations, focusing on technology-driven Bible engagement.

> BibleDojo b[y Basil Tech m](https://www.basiltech.org/)akes graduate-level biblical literacy accessible through hands-on skill application and engaging learning experiences.
> 

### Project Team

I led UX design, collaborating with visual designer and illustrator to shape the core experience. Worked cross-functionally with CTO, animator, and engineers to align product strategy, business goals, and technical execution.

## Problem

### Intimidating

![Image](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/pwebsite/portfolio_images@main/bibledojo/ZqKKH4j8WI3N63CCHk4zQsoDFY.png)

Graduate-level seminary material intimidates many users, but provides valuable textual analytical skills for deeper biblical insights.

### Information Transfer

![Image](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/pwebsite/portfolio_images@main/bibledojo/JK6msTP7PYip3v5NnTbBY0VkAzo.png)

Current LMS approaches use talking head information transfer with minimal hands-on skill development. Most users without graduate training cannot independently analyze biblical passages.

### Building Confidence

![Image](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/pwebsite/portfolio_images@main/bibledojo/dS86q8nXHmfe1lPMMHEAFzByNDo.png)

Building biblical analysis confidence requires practice and targeted feedback. Users often abandon efforts when learning feels too difficult.

## Objective

**How might we…**

- Make graduate-level knowledge accessible to non-seminary users seeking deeper biblical insights?
- Build a learning system focused on hands-on analytical skills, not just information transfer?
- Reframe trusted material into clearly structured, adaptable content that helps users overcome learning obstacles?

## Core Vision

> Create a fun and engaging online Bible education platform that empowers high schoolers and beyond to independently and accurately analyze biblical texts through a gamified ecosystem fostering skill mastery and deep learning.
> 

## BEFORE & AFTER

### Before: Training only

*(Note: Video content omitted for Markdown compatibility)*

**Note:** Case study focuses on desktop web, though designs were developed simultaneously for mobile and desktop.

## Approach

### Process Overview

*From left to right: Discover, Define, and Develop triple diamond process framework*

## User Research

### Survey

Distributed survey to 80 existing Scripture Labs subscribers focused on learning preferences, hands-on analytical skills importance, biblical education tools, and favorite learning experiences.

### Insights

Users currently rely on various tools: Bible Project videos, alternate translations, reference books, sermons, and study groups. Current platforms focus on information transfer over hands-on skills development, even fun ones emphasize passive learning. Strong demand exists for interactive, hands-on learning tools.

### Personas

Developed two main personas from user research to focus our efforts:

### Validation Research

30-minute 1:1 sessions observing users completing initial training on desktop and mobile without guidance.

**Key feedback:**

- Training took too long
- Users felt unmotivated halfway through
- Unclear progression cues

### User Journey

![Image](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/pwebsite/portfolio_images@main/bibledojo/Wc5jG0pjzE2rV2CYb8yd5DjH64.png)

Clear pain points emerged at the halfway point, creating opportunities for targeted improvements in user engagement and motivation.

## Design

### Design Strategy

Balanced four distinct areas with unique needs and constraints:

![Image](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/pwebsite/portfolio_images@main/bibledojo/AhTitZmEYAuJOZN98X0A.png)

**1. User Needs:**

Move from passive consumption to active skill mastery, clear progress visibility, defined learning pathways

**2. Learning Experience:** Martial arts belt system metaphor, metacognitive framework for informed choices, reward expertise over completion

**3. Game Design:** Clear milestones and celebrations, comprehensive dashboard view, scalable achievement structure

**4. Technology:** Mobile-first UI, seamless cross-platform experience, encourage deep learning over rapid consumption

## Architecture

### Belt Achievement



### Skills Page



## Results

### Validation Question

> Can users effectively analyze biblical text independently using skills learned from BibleDojo?
> 

### User Testing

1:1 unmoderated interviews with new and experienced users. Structure: Survey → Live Bible analysis exercise → Thought process discussion → Performance evaluation using standardized rubric.



### User Feedback

**Positive:** High marks for enjoyment and ease of use, strong skill system engagement, sustained post-signup activity validating gamification, improved biblical knowledge retention

**Areas to Improve:** 50% of users demonstrated mastery after full progression, some brand confusion around target audience

**Overall Impact:** Increased scripture comprehension confidence, improved biblical application abilities, shift from surface-level to deep scriptural engagement

### Launch Metrics

BibleDojo launched publicly in Dec 2023.



**Q1 2024 Results:**

- 36.4% user progression from home to dashboard
- 19.6-20% introduction completion rate (1 in 5 users completing full intro)

**Key insights:** Strong retention through intro flow with minimal drop-off, engaging onboarding maintains user interest, more testing needed to identify success factors

## Lessons Learned

### Key Insights

- Design scalable framework for content growth
- Balance engagement and gamification with educational depth
- Refine progression mechanics
- Simplify complex theological concepts for digestibility
- Create intuitive yet engaging progression systems

### Future Iterations

- Community features: discussion boards, leaderboards
- Granular reward systems (e.g., coins) to optimize engagement
- Expand learning paths with new genres and advanced skills

## Reflections

**Stay agile:** Adaptability was crucial for this 0-to-1 project since everything connects. Changes in one area affect others—the dashboard wasn't initially planned but became necessary as skills/belt progressions developed.

**Embrace evolution:** Pre/Post-Training pages evolved from hiding content to using blur/grayscale techniques for simpler, more engaging reveals.

**Just start:** Creating concrete references was essential for stakeholder alignment. Early feedback incorporation was crucial for 0-to-1 success.
