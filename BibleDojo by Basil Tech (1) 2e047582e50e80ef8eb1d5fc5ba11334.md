# Overview

## Background

[Basil Tech](https://basiltech.org/) is a non-profit specializing in product development for faith-based organizations, focusing on technology-driven Bible engagement.

**BibleDojo by Basil Tech** makes graduate-level biblical literacy accessible through hands-on skill application and engaging learning experiences.

## Project Team

I led UX design, collaborating with visual designer and illustrator to shape the core experience. Worked cross-functionally with CTO, animator, and engineers to align product strategy, business goals, and technical execution.

# Problem

### Intimidating

![image 1.png](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/pwebsite/portfolio_assets_bibledojo@main/portfolio_assets_bibledojo_38.png)Graduate-level seminary material intimidates many users, but provides valuable textual analytical skills for deeper biblical insights.

### Information Transfer

![image 1.png](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/pwebsite/portfolio_assets_bibledojo@main/portfolio_assets_bibledojo_39.png)

Current LMS approaches use talking head information transfer with minimal hands-on skill development. Most users without graduate training cannot independently analyze biblical passages.

### Building Confidence

![image 2.png](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/pwebsite/portfolio_assets_bibledojo@main/portfolio_assets_bibledojo_40.png)

Building biblical analysis confidence requires practice and targeted feedback. Users often abandon efforts when learning feels too difficult.

---

# Objective

**How might we…**

1. Make graduate-level knowledge accessible to non-seminary users seeking deeper biblical insights?
2. Build a learning system focused on hands-on analytical skills, not just information transfer?
3. Reframe trusted material into clearly structured, adaptable content that helps users overcome learning obstacles?

## Core Vision

> Create a fun and engaging online Bible education platform that empowers high schoolers and beyond to independently and accurately analyze biblical texts through a gamified ecosystem fostering skill mastery and deep learning.

# User Research

## Survey

Distributed survey to 80 existing Scripture Labs subscribers focused on learning preferences, hands-on analytical skills importance, biblical education tools, and favorite learning experiences.

## Insights

Users currently rely on various tools: Bible Project videos, alternate translations, reference books, sermons, and study groups. Current platforms focus on information transfer over hands-on skills development, even fun ones emphasize passive learning. Strong demand exists for interactive, hands-on learning tools.

## Personas

Developed two main personas from user research to focus our efforts:

---

# Validation Research

30-minute 1:1 sessions observing users completing initial training on desktop and mobile without guidance.

**Key feedback:**

- Training took too long
- Users felt unmotivated halfway through
- Unclear progression cues

---

# User Journey

# Results

## Validation Question

> Can users effectively analyze biblical text independently using skills learned from BibleDojo?

## User Testing

1:1 unmoderated interviews with new and experienced users. Structure: Survey → Live Bible analysis exercise → Thought process discussion → Performance evaluation using standardized rubric.

![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/pwebsite/portfolio_assets_bibledojo@main/portfolio_assets_bibledojo_24.png)

## User Feedback

**Positive:** High marks for enjoyment and ease of use, strong skill system engagement, sustained post-signup activity validating gamification, improved biblical knowledge retention

**Areas to Improve:** 50% of users demonstrated mastery after full progression, some brand confusion around target audience

**Overall Impact:** Increased scripture comprehension confidence, improved biblical application abilities, shift from surface-level to deep scriptural engagement

---

# Launch Metrics

BibleDojo launched publicly in Dec 2023.

![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/pwebsite/portfolio_assets_bibledojo@main/portfolio_assets_bibledojo_04.png)

**Q1 2024 Results:**

- 36.4% user progression from home to dashboard
- 19.6-20% introduction completion rate (1 in 5 users completing full intro)

**Key insights:** Strong retention through intro flow with minimal drop-off, engaging onboarding maintains user interest, more testing needed to identify success factors

---

# Lessons Learned

## Key Insights

- Design scalable framework for content growth
- Balance engagement and gamification with educational depth
- Refine progression mechanics
- Simplify complex theological concepts for digestibility
- Create intuitive yet engaging progression systems

## Future Iterations

- Community features: discussion boards, leaderboards
- Granular reward systems (e.g., coins) to optimize engagement
- Expand learning paths with new genres and advanced skills

---

# Reflections

**Stay agile:** Adaptability was crucial for this 0-to-1 project since everything connects. Changes in one area affect others—the dashboard wasn't initially planned but became necessary as skills/belt progressions developed.

**Embrace evolution:** Pre/Post-Training pages evolved from hiding content to using blur/grayscale techniques for simpler, more engaging reveals.

**Just start:** Creating concrete references was essential for stakeholder alignment. Early feedback incorporation was crucial for 0-to-1 success.
